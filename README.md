Welcome to Power Shop! 🛍️

Here, you can log in/register, select the right category of products, and sort by brand, price, and more. Additionally, you can sort by price range, add products to your cart, make orders via the Stripe API with mock details, and view your order history.

In this app, I've been using the following technologies:

- Frontend: React, Redux, TypeScript, Sass

For hosting, I used Vercel. 🚀
